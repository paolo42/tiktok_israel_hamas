# TikTok, the Israel-Hamas conflict and antisemitism 

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/antgoldbloom/tiktok_israel_hamas with the anti-Isreal questions skipped. The intention is to see the results only for antisemitism, because being antisemitic is not the same as being anti-Israel.

The updated results show that spending 30 minutes a day on TikTok increases the chances somebody holds anti-Semitic views by 20%, compared with 1% for Instagram and 8% for X. 

Survey was conducted between November 21 and November 27. It includes 1323 people aged between 18 and 29.
